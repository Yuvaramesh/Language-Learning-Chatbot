This component processes user inputs and prepares them for the AI models.

- **User Input Validation:** Ensures inputs are properly formatted
- **Request Routing:** Directs requests to appropriate processing components
- **Error Handling:** Manages exceptions and error responses

#### 3.2.2 Conversation Management Component
Maintains the state and flow of conversations.

- **Session Management:** Tracks active conversation sessions
- **Context Tracking:** Maintains conversation context and history
- **Message Routing:** Handles the flow of messages between user and AI

#### 3.2.3 Feedback Generation Component
Analyzes user messages and generates appropriate corrections and feedback.

- **Error Detection:** Identifies grammar, vocabulary, and structural errors
- **Correction Generation:** Creates contextually appropriate corrections
- **Explanation Creation:** Provides clear explanations for identified errors
- **End-of-Session Analysis:** Generates comprehensive session feedback

### 3.3 AI Integration Layer

The AI integration layer connects the application with OpenAI's language models to power the core functionality.

### 3.4 Data Layer

The data layer is implemented using PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

#### Database Schema:

**Conversation Table:**
- Stores metadata about conversation sessions
- Fields: id, native_language, target_language, proficiency_level, conversation_context, start_time, end_time

**Message Table:**
- Records individual messages in conversations
- Fields: id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp

**Mistake Table:**
- Tracks identified language errors and corrections
- Fields: id, conversation_id, original_text, corrected_text, explanation, timestamp

## 4. Communication Flow

### 4.1 Starting a New Conversation
1. User selects native language, target language, proficiency level, and conversation context
2. System creates a new conversation record in the database
3. AI model generates an initial message based on selected parameters
4. System displays the initial message to the user

### 4.2 Message Exchange Process
1. User sends a message in the target language
2. System records the message in the database
3. AI model processes the message, detecting any language errors
4. AI model generates a response and correction information
5. System stores the response and any identified mistakes
6. System displays the response and correction information to the user

### 4.3 End-of-Session Review
1. User chooses to end the conversation
2. System marks the conversation as completed in the database
3. AI model analyzes the entire conversation and mistakes
4. System generates a comprehensive feedback report
5. System displays the feedback report to the user

## 5. Security and Privacy Considerations

- **API Key Management:** Secure handling of OpenAI API keys
- **User Data Protection:** Minimal collection of personal information
- **Session Security:** Secure session management with Flask
- **Database Security:** Proper database connection security
- **Input Validation:** To prevent injection attacks

## 6. Scalability Considerations
